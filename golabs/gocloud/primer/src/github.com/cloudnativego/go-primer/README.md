# Cloud Native Go

## Go Primer

This repository contains some very simple Go files that illustrate Go basics.
These files are used by the **Go Primer** chapter of **Cloud Native Go**

For the individual Go files in the root directory, execute those with `go run (file)`.

You don't need to build the `NPCs` package yourself, just `go run custom-
package-consumer.go` to run the code that uses this package.
